            Photoview is a simple and user-friendly photo gallery that's made for photographers and aims to provide an easy and fast way to navigate directories, with thousands of high-resolution photos.

            You configure Photoview to look for photos and videos within a directory on your file system.
            The scanner automatically picks up your media and start to generate thumbnail images to make browsing super fast.

            When your media has been scanned they show up on the website, organised in the same way as on the filesystem.

        # Variable for Mapbox Token
        -   id: $$cap_mapbox_token
            label: Mapbox Token (OPTIONAL)
            description: |-
                To enable map related features, you need to create a mapbox token.  
                A token can be generated for free [here](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/).  
                It's a good idea to limit the scope of the token to your own domain, to prevent others from using it.  
                Leave empty to disable map related features.
